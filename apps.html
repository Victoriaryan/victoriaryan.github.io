        <p>
            Hi! Welcome to my apps page! Below are the links to some apps that I made, please check them out! I will be making 
            more apps throughout this fall and winter with the information I learn at The University of Rhode Island this year. 
            I am very excited to get started working on my apps and projects, and hopefully am able to create a few this semester
            and a few next semester of college on my own. And you are more than welcome to play/use my apps whenever you want.
