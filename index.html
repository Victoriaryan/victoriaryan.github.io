                Hi! My name is Victoria Ryan, and I am a student at The Univesity of Rhode Island. I am a Computer Science major, and I <br> 
            plan to, after college, be a Computer Programmer or a Data Scientist as my future job. I have taken classes on how to <br>
            program with the language Java, but this semester at The University of Rhode Island I will be learning on how to program <br>
            HTML and JavaScript. The class at The University of Rhode Island is called The Joy of programming, and the professor is <br>
            Dr. Vic Fay-Wolfe. The Teaching Assistants are Christian, Victoria, Noura, and Ben. I am excited to learn as much about <br>
            programming as I can, and to explore all the aspects of Computer Science!
