            Hi! My name is Victoria Ryan, and I am a student at The Univesity of Rhode Island. I am a Computer Science major,
            and I plan to, after college, be a Computer Programmer or a Data Scientist as my future job. I have taken a classes
            on how to program with the language Java, but this semester at The Univetsity of Rhode Island I will be learning on 
            how to program HTML and JavaScript. The class at The University of Rhode Island is called The Joy of programming, 
            and the professor is Dr. Vic Fay-Wolfe. The Teaching Assistants are Christian, Victoria, Noura, and Ben. I am 
            excited to learn as much about programming as I can, and to explore all the aspects of Computer Science!
